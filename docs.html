          <p>In this manual, you will find the basic information regarding Sample’s API working principles and how to use it. If you have already worked with our API or with similar services from other platforms, and you know which app you want to create, we recommend that you go to any applicable documentation section.</p>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API (application programming interface)</a> – This is an intermediary between the app’s developer and some environment with which this app should interact. This API makes it easy to create a code because it provides a set of defined classes, functions and structures for working with your data. </p>

          <h4 id="methods" class="text-body-emphasis border-bottom pt-2 pb-2">Methods and objects</h4>
          <p>Sample API – This interface allows information to be received from the sample server's database with the help of http-requests to the special server. You do not need to know in detail how the base is constructed and from which table and field types it consists of. It is enough that API-request “knows” it. The request syntax and the type of data being returned are strictly determined by the service itself.</p>
          <p>For example, to receive data about the user with the ID number “210700286”, you need to make a request of this type:</p>
          <blockquote><code>https://api.example.com/method/users.get?user_id=210700286&v=5.52</code></blockquote>
          <p>Let’s have a look at the individual parts:</p>
          <ul>
             <li><b>api.example.com/methods</b> — API server address</li>
             <li><b>users.get</b> — name of Sample API’s “method”. Methods represent conditional commands that correspond with an operation from the database to receive, record or delete information. For example, users.get is a method to receive information about a user...</li>
             <li><b>?user_id=210700286&v=5.52</b> – parameter request. After naming the method, you need to transfer its entry data (if it has it) - as usual, GET-parameters in http-requests. With our example, we tell the server that we want data about the user with <code>id=210700286</code> and that the format of this data should correspond with the API version 5.52. The entry parameter always lists the page with a description of the method.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In its response, the server returns JSON-object with the requested data (or a message about a mistake if something went wrong). JSON is the format for how data is reported in the format of “Characteristic Name”: “Value”.</p>
          <p>The response to our request looks like this:</p>
          <blockquote><code>{"response":[{"id":210700286,"first_name":"Lindsey","last_name":"Stirling"}]}</code></blockquote>
          <p>The response structure of each method is also fixed, and while working with API, you know beforehand that you will receive a number in the <b>id</b> field and a line in the <b>first_name</b> field. These rules are explained on the pages with method descriptions and corresponding objects, which are returned in the response. For example, <code>users.get</code> is where the method’s entry parameters and the structure of its response are described.</p>

          <h4 id="access" class="text-body-emphasis border-bottom pt-2 pb-2">Access rights</h4>
          <p>All the methods are divided into sections, such as friends, photos, video and so on. Often apps are created to work with a specific section. For example, to view photos or to edit videos. Logically, for an app that only works with a user’s audio player, this app does not require a user’s private messages.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the app’s access rights to API are categorized like methods. The app can request access only to communities, or to communities, photos and audio.</p>
          <p>In order to request the rights, use the parameter <code>scope</code> in the authorization dialogue. Every access right has its own unique name (<code>friends</code>, <code>video</code> and so on) and code (<i>+2, +4, +4096</i>). In <code>scope</code>, it is possible to list the names of all necessary access rights (for example, <code>scope=friends,video,photos</code>, and you can enter the sum of their codes (for example, <code>scope=22</code>).</p>
